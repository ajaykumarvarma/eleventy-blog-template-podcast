                        <li class="mb-2">You can’t make good decisions if you’re constantly pulled in a lot of different directionsChoose reflection over reaction</li>
                    
                        <li class="mb-2">People are always looking for a shortcut, but it often backfiresReading a summary of a book isn’t the same as reading the whole book</li>
                    
                        <li class="mb-2">There’s no redo at the end of life, you only get one life so aim to make good decisionsWhen you make a mistake, reflect on it and ask yourself what will you do differently next time</li>
                    
                        <li class="mb-2">Incentives play a huge role in human behavior, ask yourself: What type of incentive system you should create for your business?Should you have different incentives for different levels in the organization?How are they gamed?</li>
                    
                        <li class="mb-2">Human biases also significantly change human behaviorShane had Daniel Kahneman, who studied biases for 20+ years, on his podcast and Daniel said he’s still vulnerable to common biases</li>
                    
                        <li class="mb-2">“So much of decision-making is pattern matching” – Shane ParrishIt’s important to take the time to recognize patterns and delay intuition instead of immediately acting on it</li>
                    
                        <li class="mb-2">When making a decision, you have to think about the timelineAn owner is more likely to think long-term while a CEO looks at results one quarter at a time</li>

                        <li class="mb-2">Popular mental models: The map is not the terrain–the map is the shallow view while the terrain gives much more informationThink of a map as an online profile of someone and the terrain as actually meeting the personCircle of competence–If a decision is within your circle of competence, trusting your gut is a reasonable moveIf it’s outside your circle of competence, your gut instinct is less valuableInversion–Think about way to avoid bad outcomes so you increase your chances of a good outcome Ask yourself, how do I avoid the outcomes that I don’t want?First-order negative, second order positive–Do something that doesn’t feel good now to feel good laterGoing to the gym may suck in the short-run, but being healthy and in great shape will feel good in the long-run </li>
